Peer Review: Brock Spacek

Comments: The code works the way as intended and all 10 instances change the function of the other list. I would add buttons instead of the bootstrap list to make things change to make it look cleaner and see what you are clicking on. The "click me" button also does not seem to work. Maybe add a few styling changes to your text as well if you want to be a bit more creative, but only if you want to.
